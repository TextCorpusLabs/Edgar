# Do the thing!

I have things that need done sometimes, but not frequently enough to _exactly_ remember them.
This is an attempt to keep sufficient notes to be able to replicate the process.

The jupyter notebooks are run in [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download).
If you want to run them in [Google's CoLab](https://colab.research.google.com/), you may need to make modification.
